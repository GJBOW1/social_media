Coding Dojo Project "GroupSpace" - Gregg Bowen

This submission represents the initial 20 hours of work towards building a social media platform "GroupSpace", which allows users to affiliate themselves with a group, which will then give them access to information pertaining to other group members, including upcoming events, messages on the message board, discussion board conversations, and locations (including weather/time at those locations). Some of these services will require API connections, which will come with later iterations of the project.

In general, I didn't have any particular problems that were too challenging to overcome (yet). However, I was surprised with the sheer amount of time it required to even get to this point in my project. For that reason, one consideration for future projects is to maybe not set myself such a high bar at the beginning and instead look to take on smaller, more obtainable chunks at a time. 

While I have a while to go to complete all of my envisioned functions within the website, I am well on my way to fleshing out the framework and look forward to finishing it.
